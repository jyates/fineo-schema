// The top level protocol is merely a wrapper to use the IDL.
// The parts we care about are the actual record instances
//
// The layering and instance/schema is a bit round about, but allows us to dynamically rename both
// the metric types and the fields in a metric instance because they are actually stored under a
// canonical name. We cannot use the Avro alias for records b/c it does not support full string
// names.
